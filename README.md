### Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas

**Class Resources:**
* MovieLens 100k movie ratings ([data dictionary](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k-README.txt), [website](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/))
* Alcohol consumption by country ([article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/))
* Reports of UFO sightings ([website](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html))

**Pandas Resources:**
* Browsing or searching the Pandas [API Reference](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) is an excellent way to locate a function even if you don't know its exact name.
* To learn more Pandas, read this [three-part tutorial](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/),
or review these two excellent (but extremely long) notebooks on Pandas:
[introduction](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_1-Introduction-to-Pandas.ipynb) and
[data wrangling](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section2_2-Data-Wrangling-with-Pandas.ipynb).
* If you want to go really deep into Pandas (and NumPy), read the book [Python for Data Analysis](http://amzn.to/1JomygU), written by the creator of Pandas.
* This notebook demonstrates the different types of [joins in Pandas](notebooks/05_pandas_merge.ipynb), for when you need to figure out how to merge two DataFrames.
* This is a nice, short tutorial on [pivot tables](https://beta.oreilly.com/learning/pivot-tables) in Pandas.
